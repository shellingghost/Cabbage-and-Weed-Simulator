Program displays patterns that occur depending on certain variation of weed plant. Program highlights the utility of artificial intelligence in following and finding patterns of weed distributions in any given field. This methodology could be used not only to find what causes certain weed patterns to emerge, but also to determine what interventions work best for any given type of weed (an example of this is different pesticides which could be employed in anticipation of a new pest). By clicking through each new iteration of crops, we can see similar patterns from each type of weed.
